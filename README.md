# React Native Template
This project is my version of the front-end technical test for Jolocom.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js > 12](https://nodejs.org) and npm (Recommended: Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- [JDK > 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Android Studio and Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Base dependencies

- [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/).
- [react-native-fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5/docs/web/use-with/react-native).

## Usage

#### Use Template button

To run this application all you need to do is:

- Clone this repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run metro with `npx react-native start`
- Run the application on android with `npx react-native run-android`
- Run the application on ios with `npx react-native run-ios` (I think this works? I don't know, I don't have a mac.)

## Folder structure

This project follows a very simple folder structure:

- `src`: This folder is the main container of all the code inside the application.
  - `components`: This folder contains all components that are used in the project.
    - `screens`: This folder contains all the screens used in the project.
